Sublime, Notepad++, Eclipse, Pycharm, etc).\r\n\r\nTopics\r\n========================\r\n\r\n##Session 1: Intro to Python\r\nThis session will discuss pythonic syntax, structure, and principles. Useful built-in functions, and data structures critical for use with django will be covered. We will be using the python interactive interpreter for a portion of this lesson.\r\n\r\nFlow:\r\n\r\n* Intro to Python: Why Python?\r\n* Data Structures: Strings, Integers, Floats, Dictionaries, Lists, Tuples, Sets. Talk about differences and use cases.\r\n* Statements and Functions: if, while, for, lambda, filter, sorted, map, dir, help, pdb\r\n* something to code in class\r\n* something to take home.\r\n\r\n##Session 2: Django's architecture, design, and principles\r\nA high level overview of the various components in a django web application, and how they interoperate with each other. Django's MVC architecture will be broken down. Django's design philosophies will also be discussed.\r\n\r\n##Session 3: Building a django application Part One\r\nAn interactive session where we will build a fully functioning django application. We will walk through the tutorial presented on https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial01/. It is very well documented and will familiarize the student with the djangoproject website for future use. We will go over part 1 and part 2 in this session. This will cover core concepts on setting up a project, implementing models and utilizing the admin functionality.\r\n\r\n##Session 4: Building a django application Part Two\r\nPart 3 and 4 will be presented in this session. We will cover views and templates here. After this session the student should be equipped with all the basic skills to set up a website.\r\n\r\n##Session 5: Craftsmanship\r\nCore elements will be reviewed as students will attempt at building features for a website. They can choose from a pre-selected set of tasks or decide on something themselves. Students will present in front of the class and have their code ripped apart.\r\n\r\n##Session 6: BONUS TOPICS: NLP, BIG DATA, and SCALABILITY with DJANGO/PYTHON\r\nFundamental concepts of natural language processing will be discussed. We will build a basic spam filter using Pythons NLTK library.\r\nDatabase and server architectures that allow for scalability will be presented.\r\n","google":"UA-34606787-1","tagline":"Intro to python and django workshop"}
