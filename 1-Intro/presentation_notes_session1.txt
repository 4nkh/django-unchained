Why Python?

Python is a general-purpose, interpreted high-level programming language[12] whose design philosophy emphasizes code readability. Its syntax is said to be clear[13] and expressive.[14] Python has a large and comprehensive standard library

The biggest thing that has kept us on Python … well, there are two huge things. One are the libraries. There’s a library for everything. We’ve been learning a lot of these technologies and a lot of these architectures as we go. And, so, when I didn’t understand connection pools, I can just find a library until I understand it better myself and write our own. Don’t understand web frameworks, so we’ll use someone else’s until we make our own. Don’t understand a lot of stuff. And Python has an awesome crutch like that. And now, as we’ve been learning more, pulling more stuff back in house — just so we can have things the way we like them — it’s made the transition super super easy.

The other thing that keeps us on Python, and this is the major thing, is how readable and writable it is. When we hire new employees … I don’t think we’ve yet hired an employee who knew Python. I just say, “everything you write needs to be in Python.” Just so I can read it. And it’s awesome because I can see from across the room, looking at their screen, whether their code is good or bad. Because good Python code has a very obvious structure. And that makes my life so much easier. […] It’s extremely expressive, extremely readable, and extremely writable. And that just keeps life smooth.

for certain routines it has been shows that it is several hundred times slower than C++, not to talk about C

Excellent for beginners, yet superb for experts
Rapid development
Portable, cross-platform
Object-oriented
Powerful standard libs
Wealth of 3rd party packages

Python isn't the best for memory intensive tasks.
Python is interpreted language & is slow compared to C/C++ or java.
Python not a great choice for a high-graphic 3d game that takes up a lot of CPU.
Python is evolving continuously, with constant evolution there is little substantial documentation available for the language.


python vs php:
common: are interpreted, high level languages, dynamic typing, open source, large developer communities, extendable in java c++, very portable. almost on all platforms without compilation, variable number of function args, object serialization, method chaining,have a standardized database API ,support lambdas and other builtin functional programming constructs,

python vs ruby:
high level, garbage collected, dynamic typed
