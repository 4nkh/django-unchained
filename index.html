<h1>Session Outline</h1>

<p>Date:<br>
Time:   6pm - 7pm
Cost:   Free</p>

<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>Participants will leave this session with an understanding of pythonic principles, django's architecture, and good programming practices.</p>

<h2>Outcomes:</h2>

<p>By the end of the series, participants will have created a fully functioning django web application, and should have a background on the capability and potential of the both python and django.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Participants should be familiar with object-oriented programming.</p>

<h2>Software Required</h2>

<p>Code editor (I use Sublime Text 2, but feel free to use whatever you like)
Web browser
Python 2.7
Terminal (Mac) or Powershell (Windows)</p>

<h2>Hardware Required</h2>

<p>A computer / laptop able to run a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, IE9+), and a code editor (ie. Sublime, Notepad++, Eclipse, Pycharm, etc).</p>

<h1>Topics</h1>

<h2>Session 1: Intro to Python</h2>

<p>This session will discuss pythonic syntax, structure, and principles. Useful built-in functions, and data structures critical for use with django will be covered. We will be using the python interactive interpreter for a portion of this lesson.</p>

<p>Flow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intro to Python: Why Python?</li>
<li>Data Structures: Strings, Integers, Floats, Dictionaries, Lists, Tuples, Sets. Talk about differences and use cases.</li>
<li>Statements and Functions: if, while, for, lambda, filter, sorted, map, dir, help, pdb</li>
<li>something to code in class</li>
<li>something to take home.</li>
</ul><h2>Session 2: Django's architecture, design, and principles</h2>

<p>A high level overview of the various components in a django web application, and how they interoperate with each other. Django's MVC architecture will be broken down. Django's design philosophies will also be discussed.</p>

<h2>Session 3: Building a django application Part One</h2>

<p>An interactive session where we will build a fully functioning django application. We will walk through the tutorial presented on <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial01/">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial01/</a>. It is very well documented and will familiarize the student with the djangoproject website for future use. We will go over part 1 and part 2 in this session. This will cover core concepts on setting up a project, implementing models and utilizing the admin functionality.</p>

<h2>Session 4: Building a django application Part Two</h2>

<p>Part 3 and 4 will be presented in this session. We will cover views and templates here. After this session the student should be equipped with all the basic skills to set up a website.</p>

<h2>Session 5: Craftsmanship</h2>

<p>Core elements will be reviewed as students will attempt at building features for a website. They can choose from a pre-selected set of tasks or decide on something themselves. Students will present in front of the class and have their code ripped apart.</p>

<h2>Session 6: BONUS TOPICS: NLP, BIG DATA, and SCALABILITY with DJANGO/PYTHON</h2>

<p>Fundamental concepts of natural language processing will be discussed. We will build a basic spam filter using Pythons NLTK library.
Database and server architectures that allow for scalability will be presented.</p>
